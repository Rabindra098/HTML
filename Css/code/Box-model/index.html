        <p> Doraemon (ドラえもん) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated 
            by Fujiko F. Fujio. First serialized in 1969, the manga's chapters were

            developed, including soundtrack albums, video games, and musicals. The manga
            series was licensed for an English language release in North America, via
