        Doraemon (ドラえもん) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Fujiko F. Fujio. First serialized in 1969, the manga's 
        chapters were collected in 45 tankōbon volumes published by Shogakukan from 1974 to 1996. The story revolves around an earless
        robotic cat named Doraemon, who travels back from the 22nd century to help a boy named Nobita Nobi.

        The manga spawned a media franchise. Three anime TV series have been adapted in 1973, 1979, and 2005. Additionally, Shin-Ei
        Animation has produced over forty animated films, including two 3D computer-animated films, all of which are distributed by 
        Toho. Various types of merchandise and media have been developed, including soundtrack albums, video games, and musicals. The 
        manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America, via Amazon Kindle, by a collaboration of Fujiko F.
        Fujio Pro with Voyager Japan and AltJapan Co., Ltd. The anime series was licensed by Disney for an English-language release 
        in North America in 2014, and LUK International in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
