HTML(Hyper Text Markup language):

    HTML is used for structure/skelenton of a web page.
    HTML started by Tim Barner's Lee.
    GML ----> SGML ----> HTML. Current version of HTML is HTML5.
HTML consists of tags. tags are represented in two ways .
            i-  open tag (<tagname>).
            ii- close tag(</tagname>)
Whole HTML code is between HTML open and close tag. HTML contains two 
elements such as headd and body. head also contains title.

We can generate basic templete using emmets such as (!+enter), (html:5).
The gap on left of elements to make code more readable is khown as indentation.
